    "The path we took doing this exercise was to reverse engineer from the whole completed sentence and give unknown variables a lambda expression step by step. For example, we have started with the natural language sentence correspondence of montague grammars: \"There exists a person x who is a woman and that person x plays etude\". Then according to expressions given in e2, we have diminished the known entities and gave lambda expressions to the un-mentioned expression in e2 for a successful beta reduction. Such as, since e2 mentiones \"There is an x person(entity) who plays etude.\" The lacking expression from the whole completed sentence is a proposition that says: \"There exists an x. This e2 proposition is true under the circumstances that x is a woman.\" Which becomes our answer for e1.\n",
